# Lab 01: Setup

## Lab Goals

 - To install and set up the following:
    - Rust (rustup, cargo, rustc)
    - VSCode + rust analyzer extension
    - Git
 - To write a little bit of code

## Differences from the Java version

The Java version of this lab uses Java and Intellij, rather than Rust and VSCode.
