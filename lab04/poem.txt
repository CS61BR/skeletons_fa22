Git is such a mysterious tool,
so many commands and options, I am an ignorant fool.

I add. I commit. I merge, pull and push,
everything else turns my mind to mush.

I use aliases that make me feel 1337,
but when I dance with this devil, I have two left feet.

Panic! Merge conflict! Lost in a diff avalanche!
My detached head is left swinging from a branch.
