# Lab 4

## Differences from the Java version

 - there is no `git` portion in the Rust version, since that's language-independent 

 - Horrible Steve is having a slightly different problem! See explanation below.

### Horrible Steve

Your company, Flik Enterprises, has released a fine software library (`flik.rs`) that can square integers. 

You receive an email from someone named "Horrible Steve" who describes a problem they're having with your library:
> Dear Flik Enterprises,
> 
> Your library is very bad. See the attached code. It should be printing "Incorrect. Access Denied", but is printing "Correct. Access Granted."

Figure out whether the bug is in Horrible Steve's code or in Flik Enterprise's library, and fix the bug.

 ## Writing Code

You will be fixing a bug.

## Running Code

You can run Horrible Steve's program with `cargo run`.

## Testing Code

If you write tests, you can run them `cargo test`.

## Cleanup and Submission

make sure no errors from `cargo clippy`, and run `cargo fmt`

no submission this is just for fun
