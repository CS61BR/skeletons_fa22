## Differences from the Java version

The first part of Lab1 is setup; for Rust setup, see the "Helpful tips" section of the main README.

## Writing Code

You will be implementing `next_number` in `collatz.rs`, and optionally `is_leap_year` in `leap_year.rs`.


## Running Code

To run the leap year program, run `cargo run --bin leap_year`.

To run the collatz program, run `cargo run --bin collatz`.

## Testing Code

No tests for this lab.

## Cleanup and Submission

make sure no errors from `cargo clippy`, and run `cargo fmt`

no submission this is just for fun
